                <p>Reflecting on why many entered the field—to bring justice and prevent harm—a call for cybersecurity professionals to move away from tactics driven by vendors and metrics, and instead embrace creativity, collaboration, and partnership with end-users. </p>

                <p><strong>Presentation Abstract</strong></p>
                <p>The Human Factor: Quantifying Human Risk</p>
                <p>This talk will delve into the emerging field of human risk management and quantification, focusing on assigning risk scores to employees based on their actions and access. Similar to where cyber risk quantification was a few years ago, this field is expected to grow significantly. With over 80% of breaches involving the human element, understanding how employees affect security posture is crucial for organizations aiming to enhance their security.</p>

            <p><strong>Presentation Abstract</strong></p>
            <h4>Open Source Your Incident Response</h4>

             <p>Hackers use advanced tools tailored to particular types of engagements and environments. Understanding those to defend against them can take a level of sophistication and training that many organizations don’t have the staff or resources to dedicate. But did you know hackers also use tools freely available to anyone? That these are ones you can use for both defense and response? In this talk, you’ll learn how you can use these tools to assess and secure your infrastructure from the more advanced threats and aid in the event of an incident. You’ll learn the open source tools red and blue teams can employ, how to utilize them, and what action points they can provide for your security and IT teams. Actual demonstrations of the tools and training on how to utilize them will be provided as well as real-world stories of how these tools are common first steps in both a penetration test and incident response. This talk is for cybersecurity and IT professionals.</p>
